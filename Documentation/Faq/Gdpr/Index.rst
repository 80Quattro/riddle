GDPR
=====
riddle.com follows the rules of GDPR. All information can be found at https://www.riddle.com/blog/gdpr-quiz-maker/

#. No individual or personal data from quiz takers is being stored by Riddle quizzes – unless you are using our current Riddle lead form,  in which case you are also covered as the data is stored in your own private webspace, not accessible by anyone but you and hosted in a secure Frankfurt, Germany data center.
#. When you use Riddle to build your quiz you are creating your content in your own private webspace and your quiz takers data is stored in your private space. No one else has access to that data. This means, you are fully responsible for how you use Riddle. Our toolkit provides you with everything you need to keep your quizzes compliant with GDPR, but if you are based outside of Europe and have no European visitors on your sites, you might not need all these warnings and messages, so we are giving you the option to not show them.
#. All Riddle servers are EU-based in Germany – and we are not using Google, Amazon or any other non-European cloud provider to store data. Our data center is ISO 27001 certified (see below for more info on our data center certifications).
#. Riddle is a German company  – with the snappy name of Riddle Technologies AG.
#. No more Google Analytics – we removed our Google Analytics and Google Tag manager on Nov 11th, 2017.
#. No individual tracking of data – all tracking will be EU-based on Riddle’s all-German servers; we will only track aggregate data – never individual quiz taker information.
